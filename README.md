This Dash project study two different datasets. One of them is about FIFA football players and its ratings, and the other one analyses information about rocks from regions that have many large earthquake and landslide event.

'FIFA' allows the user to study and observe different worldwide football player stats, obtained and assigned by the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association).

It is composed by 2 interactive pages. The first one displays the player's Overall Rating in terms of different stats that the user can choose from the selector, as could be the finishing skills, ball control or player's speed, among others. In this case, there are two displaying options: visualizing the data for all players at the same time, in 'General Rating', or selecting the just the ones that play in some specific positions, in 'Rating per Position'. 

For its part, 'Top Players' exhibit a Ranking of Top Players according to their overall rating. There is a search tab in which the user selects the desired teams and nationalities, in order to visualize and have an overall idea of which players of the selected clubs and countries have the best overall rankings. This could be useful for a soccer trainer if he has to select the 26 players for facing a worldcup tournament.

'Rocks' analyse information from smear slides taken from the U.S. Geological Survey cruise 2008-008-FA cores. These cores were collected in 2008 from offshore Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands.

20 giant gravity cores were collected by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the U.S. Geological Survey. The regions sampled have had many large earthquake and landslide events, some of which are believed to have triggered tsunamis. The aim of this sampling is to determine the age of several slope failures and seismite layers. The data include data about grain-size and composition analyses.

3 different analysis are implemented in this Shiny page. The first one evaluates the types of grain size present at each depth. THere, the user can select one or more cores to observe its grain sizes. Grain size types are, in ascending order of grain size, f.sand, v.f.sand, silt and clay.

The remaining views are about composition. In 'Composition per depth', materials' abundances are plotted for a range of depth that the user select. In this way, he can observe the proportion of the different components at this depth. The abundance can be: R, Rare (1%); P, Present (1-5%); C, Common (5-25 %); or A, Abundant (25-75%). There are also some intermediate levels, like R-P, Rare to Present; P-C, Present to Common; or C-A, Common to Abundant. The materials evaluated are 4 non organic ones: Quartz, Feldspar, Dark Lithics and Manganese; and 4 organic ones: Forams, Sponge Spicules, Carbonate Fragments and Pteropods. A report in pdf can be extracted from this evaluation.

In the last display screen, the user can select an one or more specific materials and visualize its abundance for each depth.
